TimelyApp.com Clone Project
In this blog post, I’m going to talk about timelyapp.com clone, a website that we built up for our Unit-5 construct week submission. Website development is fun when all the team members collaborate and make a good website. Let me introduce you to my team-mates (in no particular order)

As we are still in the learning phase, the journey of building this website was very nice. We realised we could’ve achieved even more precision in building the website, but time was running out.

We still managed to pull this job to satisfactory results. Everyone was happy about it, it was like working hard on the farm, and then reaping the benefits of the tasty grains. The feeling of completing the project was very satisfying. Hard work pays off.
